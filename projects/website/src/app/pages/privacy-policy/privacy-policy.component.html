                    information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on
                    file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have
                    previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

                    information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the
                    purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
                    such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
